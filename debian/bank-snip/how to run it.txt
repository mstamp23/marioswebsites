This is the "Maximum Efficiency" setup for a Debian 13 XFCE user.

It uses Zenity, which is part of the GNOME/GTK family. It is ultra-native to Debian, takes zero resources while idle, and pops up instantly. I have designed this script to handle your specific requirements: a dropdown list, a custom date format, and an input for the amount.

1. Install Dependencies
You'll need zenity (for the pop-up) and imagemagick (to ensure the JPG conversion is perfect).

Bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install zenity imagemagick xfce4-screenshooter

. How to link it to your Keyboard
Go to Settings > Keyboard > Application Shortcuts.

Click Add.

Command: bash /home/yourusername/banking-snip.sh (Replace with your actual username).

Press your hHome key .

chmod +x /home/YOUR_USERNAME/banking-snip.sh
